Hey! I'm Woody, a fourth-year undergrad at <a href="https://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC</a>✌️.

I do research on NLP and multimodal models for vision and audio. I'm interested in understanding how AI models actually work under the hood and building better ways to evaluate them.

Currently, I'm working with Professor <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/" target="_blank">Vatsal Sharan</a> at USC PALMS Lab🌴. I'm also very fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://willieneis.github.io/" target="_blank">Willie Neiswanger</a> and Professor <a href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~soltanol/" target="_blank">Mahdi Soltanolkotabi</a>. I visited <a href="https://saltlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford SALT Lab</a>🌲 this past summer, supervised by Professor <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/" target="_blank">Diyi Yang</a>. I'm grateful to learn from my amazing PhD mentors <a href="https://deqingfu.github.io/" target="_blank">Deqing Fu</a> at USC and <a href="https://williamheld.com/" target="_blank">William Held</a> at Stanford.

When I'm not training models or writing papers, you can find me playing or watching soccer⚽. I play left wing and people say I'm the next Vini Jr—hit me up if your team needs a good player! I also volunteer through <a href="https://www.volunteermatch.org/" target="_blank">VolunteerMatch</a>. Always happy to connect with others who want to give back to the community!
